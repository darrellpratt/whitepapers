# Tablet History

0. **Cover**

Although tablet computers are perceived as an invention of recent years, the tablet concept has existed in rudimentary forms since the 1960’s. The modern tablet has evolved from these original concepts and in some cases have taken quite divergent paths.

0.1 **Intro**

The tablet computing concept has its origins in the 1960s as a rough concept first put forward by Alan Kay. This original idea was termed the Dynabook but was not put into any production at the time. The idea however set the early ground work for the idea of a highly mobile computing device for mass consumption. Tablets and smaller devices have continuously evolved since these early designs and have led to the current set of devices that dominate the market.  Each generation can be seen to have slowly increased the adoption rates but key features have certainly created large spikes in adoption rates over time.



1. **Inputs & Form factors**

1.1 **Pen based**

The first commercial portable computers that most resembled the tablets of today used a pen based input methodology. Effectively a pen replaced the mouse to allow the user select items on the screen and input text onto a displayed keyboard when needed. Both PenPoint OS and Windows for Pen Computing were available on the market in the early 90s, but both were basically a one to one migration from what a user could perform on a laptop computer of the time. Neither of these systems gained the level of traction seen today in the market, due to a variety of reasons, but the foremost was still the need for some sort of tether to synchronize data between the device and other systems.

At this same time Apple began to work on the Newton device.  This was another pen based mobile tablet packaged with a specific operating system (Newton OS) for mobile computing.  Although the project began as a general purpose computing device, it was re-engineered as a personal digital assistant (PDA) device and began that specific market.

1.2 **Size**

The early tablets were released from the late 80s to mid 90s and  due to the technology of the time the form factor and relative size was generally quite larger than the devices of today. Most devices gravitated toward the ruggedized form factor with screen sizes being between 7 and 12 inches. (citation needed).

1.3 **OS**

Initially, the tablet or pen based computing devices either used a Microsoft variant of Windows (3.1 through to XP) or a specific operating system that provided an personal assistant style devices. Microsoft released several pen based operating systems through the 90s, but each of these releases merely served to provide pen input on top of the standard Windows release of the time. 

The second branch of tablets moved toward a set of PDA based operating systems.  These systems included the Newton OS from Apple, Palm and several smaller players. These operating systems provided a more streamlined experience for the user who was primarily concerned with using a tablet style device as an electronic metaphor the datebooks of the time.



2. **Small PC vs. PDA**

The tablet market generally originated as a truly mobile concept of a general computing device but quickly split into two separate lines.  The generic computing path was pushed by Microsft and some Linux platforms and the PDA path was pushed by  Palm and Apple with their respective platforms.


2.1 **Newton (1993)**

Apple's Newton platform truly originated the PDA market.  The personal digital assitant was given to the device at the time by the CEO John Sculley.  The Newton focused primarily on pen based input into specific applications that would aid a user in organizing facets of their life such as address book entries, notes and calendar appointments.  Applications could be written for the device in a scripting language, but these applications were not at the level of diversity we see in today's marketplace.

2.1.1 **Form and progression**

The Newton family of devices like many other devices started as a fairly large device. The first devices to be relasesd on the Newton platform was the MessagePad H1000 and weighed in at 1.5 pounds with a screen size of 7 by 4 inches.  Each subsequent devices released on the platform was generally lighter than the previous but screen sizes varied over time from smaller devices to much larger screens.  The resolutions remained around 320 by 240 pixels to 480 to 320 with gray scale displays.  This limited resolution and lack of color certainly limited the types of applicaitons that could be considered truly useful on this platform.

2.2 **Palm**

The Palm Pilot was released as the first generation device from Palm computing in 1996.  This device was similar in may regards to the Apple Newton platform in that it was a PDA style device with a pen input and an operating system tailored to the tracking of every day tasks. The Pilot and its succesors were quite a bit smaller than the Newton devices and were well received at the time by the corporate sector.


2.2.1 **Form and Progression**

The Palm devices evolved along the lines of connectivity and storage through the late 90s into the 2000s where the Palm OS was mostly used on smart phone devices.  Products such as the Palm Tungsten PDA did make some inroads into the smart phone marketplace but at this point the Apple iPhone held the dominate position.

2.3 **Microsoft Tablet PC**

Microsoft released a series of variants of the Tablet PC operating system from 2002 on to the present (Surface can be traced from these beginnings).  The operating system has generally been a pen based offering of the current iteration of Windows and has followed each of the major releases from Windows 3.1 through to Windows 8. In 2002 Microsoft released hardware design specification for OEMs to create tablets to run their platform and several tablets and convertible style notebooks were released to the market.


2.3.1 **Form and Progression**

OEMs produced many variants of the Microsoft platform over the years in form factors comprised of devices more akin to traditional tablets to booklet styles devices with keyboards attached and convertible style laptops that could be used as either a traditional laptop or a slate to write on using the included stylus.

These tablets did enjoy some success in vertical markets such as healthcare but the many disadvantages, not limited to cost, weak video capabilities and poor ergonomics kept the devices from achieving any critical mass needed for them to move into the wider consumer marketplace.


3. **Modern tablets**

Modern tablets have truly become mobile general purpose computing devices.  With the addition of both WiFi and mobile wireless capabilities these devices have allowed customers to access the web and run many of the same style of application they would normally use a laptop computer. 

3.1 **Progression from iPod Touch and iPhone**

While not a tablet in the current sense of the term, the iPod and iPhone devices from Apple certainly set the standard for mobile computing.  Starting with the iPhone, Apple added a very important piece of technology to a mass produced consumer device -- multi-touch.  Multi-touch technology had been in development by smaller companies for some time, but the iPhone in 2007 was the first such device to bring this to a large number of consumers.  While most of the early devices had used a pen based approach for input, the iPhone was the first device to allow a user to interact with the device with multiple fingers at the same time.  This allowed for new metaphors of interaction such as pinch to zoon, spin to rotate, etc.  These are all in fact still under patent protection from Apple.

Similar to the Tréo line of devices from Palm, the iPhone's ability to use both WiFi and mobile wireless technologies allowed a user to access the same set of information they would normally have used either at home or the office and this certainly had a large impact on the adoption of the product.

3.1.1 **Apple iPad**

The first iPad was released April 3, 2010.  Apple took the known formula from the successful iPhone and iPod Touch line of devices and scaled up the interface, boosted the storage capacity and added higher performance processors. The iPad included the same range of sensors as the iPhone, excluding the camera which was added in the iPad 2 model which was released in March of 2011.

The iPad line included models with WiFi and 3G wireless connectivity at the time and the Apple App Store was well established from the time of the iPhone SDK release.  This gave the iPad an immediate advantage over past competitors because users were immediately given access to a very large quantity of applications that could be run on the iPad at the time of the launch. In addition to these existing iPhone application a large number of iPad specific apps were released that took advantage of the larger screen size and propelled the sales numbers of the iPad devices.

Battery life of the devices can not be overlooked either.  The stated life of the lithium polymer batteries in the iPad gave the user 9 - 10 hours of usage while accessing the network over WiFi or 3G (later LTE as well). This gave the tablet an immediate advantage over the smaller laptops of the time which could deliver at best 7 hours of usage on a single charge.


3.1.2 **Interface** (specific for touch)

The iPad uses the same input mechanism as the iPhone which is the capacitive mutli touch system patented by Apple.  This system allows the user to use multiple fingers to control the device and applies heuristics to determine user intent to avoid phantom touches or device border touches.

Apple iOS itself interprets the touch commands and allows the user to perform the full set of multi touch gestures. One change that the iPhone and iPad as well as most of the newer tablets have made over the earlier style of devices is the inclusion of a virtual keyboard for inputting text into the system.  Many earlier devices used handwriting technology that was considered by most to be difficult to learn.

Touch technology has most certainly been a large factor in the success of the iPad as well as other tablets.  Games in the various app stores are routinely the #1 sellers and touch input has created completely new genres of gaming.  Older game system makers such as Nintendo and Sony have both seen their sales numbers plummet in recent years and each have sited the tablet devices as major causes of their troubling sales figures.

3.1.3 **App Store**

Apple launched the App Store on July 10, 2008. The store allowed developers of applications to upload their applications through the store and be available after a review process to any user of on of the iDevices.  Although the store launched with around 500 applications, as of 2013 Apple reports that there are approximately 800,000 applications available for download. (http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/01/28Apple-Updates-iOS-to-6-1.html).

The mobile application store has truly changed the landscape of software sales for consumers as traditionally, applications were sold at prices far above the now average price of 99 cents at most mobile app stores.
